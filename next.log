 ΓÜá See more info here: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/invalid-next-config
 ΓÜá Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of C:\Users\ahmed\Documents\github\C0015-Myte-Constructon\package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `outputFileTracingRoot` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output#caveats for more information.
